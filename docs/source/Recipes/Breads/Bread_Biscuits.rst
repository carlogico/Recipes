===================

.. makes::
   24 biscuits

.. ingredients::

   - 375 g AP flour (3 cups)
   - 4.5 tsp baking powder
   - 0.75 tsp cream of tartar
   - 2.5 tbsp sugar
   - 0.75 tsp salt

.. procedure::

   Preheat the oven to 450F. Grease a baking sheet.
   Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl.
   Add the butter in small pieces (or grate it) until a coarse crumb consistency.
   In a separate bowl, beat the egg and milk together.
   Slowly add the egg and milk mixture to the dry ingredients mixing as you go.
   Stop when it's before it gets too sticky (might not need all of the mixture).
   Invert the dough on a lightly floured surface and pat it down to about 1" thick.
   Cut fun shapes out of it (moons are good).
   Bake for about 12 minutes or until lightly browned on top.
