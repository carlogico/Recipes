Rough Puff Pastry
=================

.. multiply::

.. makes::
   :amnt:`2` pie crusts or :amnt:`1` top and bottom.

.. ingredients::

   - :amnt:`150 g` water, cold from the fridge, plus some extra in a different container
   - :amnt:`300 g` butter, cut in 1.5cm cubes, just about defrosted
   - :amnt:`450 g` AP flour, also fridge temperature
   - :amnt:`5 g` salt

.. tools::

   - large bowl
   - bench scraper
   - rolling pin
   - plastic wrap

.. procedure::

   In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt thoroughly. Add the cubes of butter and coat them with the flour.
   Squeeze the butter cubes between your fingers to flatten them down. If they are too solid,
   wait a little bit and try again...

   Drizzle the :amnt:`150 g` of water over the mixture and gently incorporate with your fingers, do not knead.
   Once incorporated, invert the bowl onto the working surface. It should be very shaggy and dry, with lots of dry flour hanging around.
   Gather the "dough" into a rough square and start rolling. The goal is to flatten the butter even more into very thin sheets.
   Use the bench scraper to fold the "dough" onto itself (it is still expected for it to not fully hold together here)
   and continue rolling. Repeat this a couple of times. If the dough is extra dry (more than 15% of the flour is still dry) add some extra water.
   Once the dough is mostly together, divide in two. Cut a ~1m long piece of plastic wrap.
   Place half of the dough in the plastic wrap and wrap it tightly. Roll the resulting packet so that the dough
   fits snugly in the plastic wrap.
   Repeat with the other half.

   At this point you can either freeze the dough to be used in the next three months (wrap it in some aluminum foil outside the plastic wrap),
   or rest in the fridge or freezer until pretty solid but still pliable (usually 20 mins in the freezer).
   Take it out, and plop it on a floured surface. I usually divide it in 4 pieces and stack them on top of each other.
   Flatten the dough by bashing it with a rolling pin. Once it is about 2 cm thick, start rolling it out to your desired thickness.

   In an average pie, this will take about 40-50 minutes in a 350F oven.
