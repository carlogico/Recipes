=====================

.. multiply::

.. ingredients::

   For the tangzhong:

   - :amnt:`43 g` bread flour
   - :amnt:`86 g` milk

   For the rolls:

   - :amnt:`300 g` bread flour
   - :amnt:`113 g` milk
   - :amnt:`40 g` butter
   - :amnt:`1` egg
   - :amnt:`5 g` instant yeast
   - :amnt:`30 g` sugar
   - :amnt:`6 g` salt

.. procedure::

   Combine milk and flour in a skillet and cook on medium heat until it forms a gelatinous paste
   (about 5 minutes).

   Mix everything (including the paste from the previous step) with stand mixer at medium-high speed for 5 minutes (until it forms a ball).
   Make a ball, cover dough, let rise for 1-2 hours.
   Deflate the dough, divide in 4 parts, shape into flat rectangles and roll them up.
   Place the rolls in a loaf pan.
   Let rise for 40 minutes - 1 hour. Egg wash.
   Cook in a 350F oven until ready (25 minutes). Add a container with water in the oven for the first 5-10 minutes.

.. note::

   in the stand mixer, before adding the butter, the dough seemed too dry.
   Add water but overshot it. Added more flour...
   I think the recipe can take a bit more liquid (maybe :amnt:`5` - :amnt:`10` g?)
